# pyautomation
In this project my plan was to automate a tedious task from work in excel. 
The task required me to enter data based on specific criteria in the workbook. 
There was over 1000 lines of data and we had to enter the data based on certain criteria and instead of me sifting through each line which would have taken over an hour. I had used python to automate the process.
To do this I checked which cells the criteria was in and when I coded checked if the criteria matched with its specific counter parts. If it did then the correct data was displayed in a NEW workbook. 
I created a new workbook so i would always have the original to work off and so that if I made any errors the original would not lose data in any way. 
In doing this a tedious task which would have taken over an hour was done in just a click of a button. 
I know this would not just be used for this specific purpose as i can change the code to fit another workbook and its criteria when needed.
